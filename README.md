# JHMedical Website

This is a functional website for an optical equipment company based here in Utah. We we're hired to have a fully functional website, that shows the available equipment, and if signed in to a verified user, view prices. It's currently deployed to heroku until the client is ready to use it.

## Usage

To use, click through the links to products, and see the products available. Then sign in with the given verified users, and you'll see prices on those products.
